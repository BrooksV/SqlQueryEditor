SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Provides functionality for executing SQL queries and managing SQL datasets.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The SqlQueryEditor module provides a set of functions and cmdlets for working with SQL Server databases. 
    It includes functionality for connecting to a SQL Server, executing SQL queries, and managing the results in datasets.
    This module is designed to simplify database operations and improve productivity by offering a set of easy-to-use cmdlets.

    The main cmdlet provided by this module is New-SqlQueryDataSet, which allows you to create and configure a SqlQueryDataSet object
    based on the provided parameters.

EXAMPLES
    Example 1: Connecting to a SQL Server and executing a query
    PS> $result = New-SqlQueryDataSet -SQLServer "myServer" -Database "myDB" -Query "SELECT * FROM myTable"
    This example demonstrates how to connect to a SQL Server and execute a query to retrieve data from a table.

    Example 2: Using a connection string to execute a query
    PS> $result = New-SqlQueryDataSet -ConnectionString "Server=myServer;Database=myDB;User Id=myUser;Password=myPass;" -Query "SELECT * FROM myTable" -DisplayResults $false
    This example demonstrates how to use a connection string to connect to a SQL Server and execute a query without displaying the results.

TROUBLESHOOTING
    If you encounter issues while using the SqlQueryEditor module, ensure that the SQL Server and Database parameters are correctly specified.
    Verify that the connection string is valid and that the SQL Server is accessible. Check for any errors in the SQL query and make sure
    that the table name, if specified, exists in the database.
